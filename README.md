# README

WORKSPACES is an online app that helps you find the best spaces in NYC to do your work.

Workspace is a curated database of FREE spots in the city where you can set up a laptop and headphones or a notebook and pen and get to work! From spacious to cafes to hotel lobbies, museums to libraries, Workspace welcomes suggestions of all your favorite spots to work-from-home, away from home.

This is a MVP of an app only features workspaces in Manhattan, NY. But in future iterations, all of New York City, as well as other cities, will be included!

## Background

The Work From Home (WFH) phenomenon accelerated in 2020, during the Covid Lockdown. It provies an excellent alternative to the office, and it is unsurprising that it still exists today. But staying HOME to work isn't always productive. There are distractions everywhere. Couches, beds, TVs, games, romantic partners, oh my! For those of us that WFH, we often need to GTF out of H just to focus. 

That's why I created Workspace. 

WorkSpace is a local-led collection of the BEST, free places to work in your city. 
We do NOT include Shared-office/Coworking businesses (ex. WeWork, Workbar, ImpactHub, etc.) which charge limb by limb. 
Rather we include the other kinds of places suitable for working, free (ok you might have to buy a snack so they don't kick you out) to the public. 

### Example workspaces

Libraries are a classic. 
Cafes are an obvious choice -- but not ALL of them are IDEAL for work. 
Some resturaunts and diners are better than others to 'set up camp'. 
There are some hotels, too (and no you don't need to book a room -- just walk in and get comfy!). 
And in NYC, there are even Publically Owned Private Spaces (POPS) -- many which often TONS of space, in beautiful atmospheres

Workspace features THOSE kinds of places.

### User Interaction

The app allows anyeone, even businesses, to ADD a workspace! 
Your suggestions go under a brief review, and we do have a cap per city -- only 1 workspace per 1000 people may be added!)
Of course, the BEST places don't always remain so for long. 
Each WorkSpace accepts a rating and user review. 

### Idea for the expanded app

-Create a user/password wall, where any users may review, vote reviews up or down. And verified users may post new workspaces.
-Add a function to choose Workspaces by cities with high telework shares: DC, Austin, San Francisco, Seattle, Scottsdales, Chicago, Los Angeles.
-Add sort function to filter workspaces by type (cafes, hotels, libraries, diners, etc.)
