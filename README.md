# README

WORKSPACES is an online app that helps you find the best spaces in NYC to do your work.

Workspace is a curated database of FREE spots in the city where you can set up a laptop and headphones or a notebook and pen and get to work! From spacious to cafes to hotel lobbies, museums to libraries, Workspace welcomes suggestions of all your favorite spots to work-from-home, away from home.

This is a MVP of an app only features workspaces in Manhattan, NY. But in future iterations, all of New York City, as well as other cities, will be included!

## Background

The WFH (Work From Home) phenomenon accellerated in 2020. WFH is an excellent, often preferable alternative to the office. But staying HOME to work isn't always productive. 
WorkSpace is a curated collection of the BEST places to work in the city. 

## User Interaction

Of course, the BEST places don't always remain so for long. Each WorkSpace accepts a rating and user review. The app encourages suggestions, too, to add a workspace, or remove one that has totally lost its brilliance. Onward!

## Idea for the expanded app.
