Outer WorkSpace

Awesome, free spaces to 'work from home', away from home.
Currently only featuring workspaces in Manhattan, NY. 
The WFH (Work From Home) phenomenon started in 2020. It's an excellent, often preferable alternative to the office. But staying HOME to work isn't always comfortable, or productive. 
WorkSpace is a curated collection of the BEST places to work in the city. 

User interaction: Of course, the BEST places don't always remain so for long. So each WorkSpace accepts a rating and user review. The app encourages suggestions, too, to add a workspace, or remove one that has totally lost its brilliance. Onward!
