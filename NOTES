BLOG 

Like many people, I work from home. But thanks to a girlfriend, a guitar, and a TV, I sometimes have trouble focusing on the work itself. So I gotta get out. I live in New York City. There are a TON of places to 'work-from-home' away from home. The problem is that it is New York City, and there are a TON of places in general. I've looked around online, and find little lists of "Top 5 Places to ___" or "Top 10 ____". But a central database that COLLECTS these places, and allows users to suggest more? There isn't one that I've found. So I made it.

Have suggestions? Add them here, and we will review them.
